# Four stage status of a state ?

I am writing this out of tired feelings of some pity behaviour from some popular web apps.

Lets start with a simple question.

🤠︎Note: You don't need to be a person to know anything 🙈︎ of software, or any 💩︎ about framework or software library.

## Q. Have you ever noticed when you make a comment in post say on a popular site and you notice its added there and it looks good as you did 🤠︎something. But as soon as you refresh page, you realise IT WASN'T 🛑︎ REAL

FYI: I am not talking about 👥︎ __facebook__, but mostly every other website, __fb__ has literally invested billions on software alone so that your backend doesn't feel bad about. I mean to say subconscious mind 🥝︎ though.

🦑︎Fun fact: If facebook had invested in mobile devices as well, every one of us would definitely had a fb™︎ mobile handset in your hand right now.

*So what is four stage 🤬︎ status of state anyway ?*

Have you ever noticed the whatsapp shows you 4 stage status of the state. 

Ans. 🤺︎ Probably you would have.

🐥︎ Really ?

When you message somebody with whatsapp, you would have noticed mostly when network isn't very good you see the clock sign ⏲︎ with the message. And as soon as the network gets better the sign changes to single grey tick.

Now you know you have done your part and whatsapp will deliver that message to your 🧑︎‍🤝︎‍🧑︎ dear one. But after some time when the user at the other end has network signals and received the message in the device, you get to see the double greyed ticks. And then comes the final 🧿︎ thing what we see mostly i.e., double blue links and that notifies us that the user finally saw the message🦕︎.

That seems really simple and who cares about the implementation in software unless you are the one driving such business with such services and earning good amount of money 💰︎💰︎ from that.

**Q. But does this even worth reading about this** 🤹︎? 

I don't know but today I came across some bugs

- **linkedin** shows notifications every 2 seconds in the document title for user messages even after you saw that message. I don't know how many of us even notice this🤨︎.

- Posting a message on **linkedin** does persist and doesn't show any notification if the network is offline and that creates a falsy assumption that its actually posted, but isn't posted actually if network is down for some reason🥺︎.

- My today's **hackerrank** interview exam panel is partially brocken or what ? But they suggest to use their recently developed online IDE which is just a copy of codesandbox IMO 🥵︎.

💓︎ Promotions 

Because my heart says so...

- I am a huge fan of [codesandbox](codesandbox.io) and do use it [frequently](https://codesandbox.io/u/sahilrajput03) from past 1 year. The cool thing about codesandbox like environments is you can **start** any project by pressing less than 10 letters on your keyboard. Can't believe ? visit [react.new](https://react.new) to create a react starter project live in your browser and the other one is [js.new](https://js.new) to create a bare html+js+css project under 3-4 seconds, isn't that magic 🤹︎.
