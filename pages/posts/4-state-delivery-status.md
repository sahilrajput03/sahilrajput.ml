# Four stage status of a state ?

I am writing this out of tired feelings from some pity behaviour in some popular web apps.

Lets start with a simple question.

🤠︎Note: You don't need to be a person to know 🙈︎ anything of software or any 💩︎ about framework or software library.

## Q. Have you ever noticed when you make a comment in post say on a popular site and you notice its added there and it looks good as you did 🤠︎something. But as soon as you refresh page, you realise IT WASN'T EVEN 🛑︎ REAL

FYI: I am not talking about 👥︎ __facebook__, but mostly every other website, __fb__ has literally invested millions on software alone (open source @ [reactjs](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)) so that your backend doesn't feel bad about. I mean to say subconscious mind 🥝︎.

🦑︎Fun fact: If facebook had invested in mobile devices as well, every one of us would definitely had a fb™︎ mobile handset in our hands right now.

*So what is four stage 🤬︎ status of state anyway ?*

Have you ever noticed the whatsapp shows you 4 stage status of the state.

🤺︎ Ans. __Probably you have.__

🐥︎ Really ?

When you message somebody with whatsapp, you would have noticed mostly when network isn't very good you see the clock sign ⏲︎ with the message for a few moments. And as soon as the network gets better the sign changes to single ✔︎ grey tick.

Now you know you have done your part and whatsapp servers will deliver that message to your 🧑︎‍🤝︎‍🧑︎ dear one. But after some time when the user at the other end has network signals in the device she/he sees the message, you get to see the double greyed ticks then. And then comes the 🧿︎final thing what our eyes are most  comfortable  with i.e., double blue links and that notifies us that the user actually has seen the message🦕︎.

That seems really simple and who cares about the software implementation unless you are the one driving such business with such services and earning good amount of money 💰︎💰︎ from that.

**Q. But does this even worth reading about this** 🤹︎? 

I don't know but today I came across some bugs

- **linkedin** shows notifications every 2 seconds in the document title for user messages even after you saw that message. I don't know how many of us even notice this🤨︎.

- If the network is offline posting a comment on **linkedin** post does persist and doesn't show any notification that its in the first stage of state, that creates a falsy assumption to user that its actually posted, but isn't posted actually if network is down for some reason🥺︎.

- My today's **hackerrank** interview exam panel is partially brocken __or what__ ? But they suggest to use their recently developed online IDE which is just a copy of codesandbox IMO 🥵︎.

💓︎ Promotions

Because my heart says so...

- I am a huge fan of [codesandbox](codesandbox.io) and do use it [frequently](https://codesandbox.io/u/sahilrajput03) from past 1 year. The cool thing about codesandbox like environments is you can **start** any project by pressing less than 10 letters on your keyboard. Can't believe ? visit [react.new](https://react.new) (* or type that directly in __chrome__ or __firefox__) to create a react starter project live in your browser and the other one is [js.new](https://js.new) to create a bare html+js+css project under 3-4 seconds, isn't that magic 🤹︎.
