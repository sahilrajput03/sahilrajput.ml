# Private and Public keys ?

First of all there's so much confusion i.e., <i>Private key</i> and <i>Public key</i> shit on the internet. I mean thats not shit but I just meant to say all the crappy elements that are assumed by almost everyone to teach how this private and public key thing works.

Its called **Assymetric Cryptography**. Thats actually something you can digest easily 🤫︎ before learning anything about it I guess.

First of all think about this, consider we have two types of locks say LOCK A 🔐︎ i.e., which has a key and second lock LOCK B 🔐︎ which has a locking key and a unlocking key.

LOCK A can locked and unlocked with its key obviously.

In LOCK B, the locking key is known as <i>Public key</i>, and the unlocking key is known as <i>Private key</i>.
